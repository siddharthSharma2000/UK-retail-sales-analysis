# UK Retail Sales Analysis

## Business Context
A UK-based retail company wants to understand its sales performance across different regions and product categories to support better commercial decision-making.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyse retail sales data to:
- Identify high and low performing regions
- Understand product category performance
- Compare weekday and weekend sales trends

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning and preparation)
- SQL (data analysis and querying)
- Tableau (data visualisation and dashboards)

## Key Business Insights

Based on the initial analysis of retail sales data, the following insights were identified:

- Sales performance varies significantly across regions, indicating uneven market penetration.
- Certain product categories consistently outperform others, suggesting an opportunity to optimise product mix.
- Weekend sales contribute a substantial share of revenue, highlighting the importance of weekend-focused promotions.

### Product Category Performance

Product category performance is uneven, with certain categories driving a disproportionate share of total revenue while others underperform. This suggests differences in customer demand and product effectiveness across categories. A review of pricing, promotions, and product assortment for underperforming categories could help improve overall sales performance.

### File Management Strategy
Due to the large scale of the dataset (500,000+ rows), the analysis followed a "Reporting Layer" approach:
- **Source Data:** Processed locally to bypass browser upload limits.
- **Reporting Layer:** The `Retail_Performance_Report.xlsx` contains the final pivot models, benchmarking logic, and visualizations, ensuring a lightweight and accessible portfolio for stakeholders.

## Status
This project is currently in progress.
