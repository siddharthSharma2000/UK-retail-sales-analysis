# UK Retail Sales Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project analyses over 500,000 UK retail sales transactions to evaluate sales performance across regions and product categories, and to compare weekday versus weekend sales behaviour. The objective of the analysis is to generate actionable business insights that support commercial decision-making related to regional strategy, product assortment, and promotional planning. The analysis was designed to mirror real-world business analyst workflows, from raw data preparation to insight-driven recommendations.

## Business Context
A UK-based retail company required a data-driven understanding of sales performance across different regions and product categories to support better commercial decision-making.

## Business Objectives
The objectives of this analysis were to:
- Identify high and low performing regions
- Analyse product category sales performance
- Compare weekday and weekend sales trends
- Provide insights to support commercial and operational decisions

## Data Overview
The dataset contains over 500,000 transaction-level retail sales records from a UK-based retailer. Each row represents an individual sales transaction, allowing detailed analysis across time, region, and product category.

Key data fields include:
- Transaction Date
- Region
- Product Category
- Quantity Sold
- Sales Value

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, the raw dataset required cleaning and preparation to ensure data quality and consistency. Key steps included:
- Removing duplicate and invalid records
- Standardising date formats and region names
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Creating derived fields such as weekday vs weekend indicators
- Preparing a clean, analysis-ready dataset for reporting and visualisation

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning and preparation)
- SQL (data analysis and querying)
- Tableau (data visualisation and dashboards)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Translating business problems into analytical questions
- Cleaning and validating large-scale datasets
- Writing SQL queries for aggregation and trend analysis
- Developing insight-driven business recommendations
- Communicating findings through executive-ready reports and dashboards

## Key Analysis Performed
The analysis focused on answering core business questions through:
- Regional sales performance benchmarking
- Product category contribution analysis
- Weekday versus weekend sales comparison
- Identification of high and low performing segments

## Key Business Insights
Based on the initial analysis of retail sales data, the following insights were identified:

- Sales performance varies significantly across regions, indicating uneven market penetration.
- Certain product categories consistently outperform others, suggesting an opportunity to optimise product mix.
- Weekend sales contribute a substantial share of revenue, highlighting the importance of weekend-focused promotions.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Increase promotional activity and staffing during weekends to maximise high-demand periods
- Focus investment on high-performing regions while reviewing strategy for underperforming areas
- Optimise product assortment by supporting top-performing categories and reassessing underperforming ones
- Use category-level performance insights to guide pricing and promotional decisions

## File Management Strategy
Due to the large scale of the dataset (500,000+ rows), the analysis followed a "Reporting Layer" approach:
- **Source Data:** Processed locally to bypass browser upload limits.
- **Reporting Layer:** The `Retail_Performance_Report.xlsx` contains the final pivot models, benchmarking logic, and visualizations, ensuring a lightweight and accessible portfolio for stakeholders.

## Next Steps
Planned future enhancements include:
- Profit and margin analysis by product category
- Customer segmentation and basket analysis
- Promotional uplift and seasonality analysis
- Expansion of Tableau dashboards for executive reporting
